This is a rather simple elevator model implemented in OOP style in Python3
The project follows given algorythm to transport random individuals
between randomly generated amount of floors. The resident must push the button
to instruct the system which way he/she needs to go. The limit of the passengers in
the elevator is 5. Once passenger reached desired floor, he chooses another one.
If the elevator is not full, it will stop to get more people.
